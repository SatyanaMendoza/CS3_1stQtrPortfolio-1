# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with three to five sentences.
  1. **Variable Declaration** - a variable declaration is when you create a "container" to store a value, like a number or text. You can declare variables using var, let, or const.
     Let allows values to change, const makes the value fixed, and var is older. A variable must have a name (called an identifier) so you can use it later in your code.For example: 
     let age = 15; declares a variable named age with the value 15
  2. **Logical Operators** - In JavaScript, logical operators are symbols used to connect or compare two or more conditions. The most common are && (AND), || (OR), and ! (NOT). && is true 
     only if both conditions are true, || is true if at least one condition is true, and ! flips a condition from true to false (or vice versa). For example: (5 > 3 && 2 < 4) is true, 
     while !(5 > 3) is false.
  3. **Assignment Operators** - In JavaScript, assignment operators are used to give values to variables. The most common is =, which assigns a value (e.g., let x = 10;). There are als
     shorthand assignment operators like +=, -=, *=, and /= that update the value of a variable based on its current value. For example, if x = 5, then x += 3 will make x equal to 8.
  4. **Conditional Statements** - conditional statements let your program make decisions based on whether something is true or false. The most common one is if, which runs code only if 
     the condition is true. You can add else if for more conditions and else to run code when none of the conditions are true.
  5. **Relational Operators** - relational operators are used to compare two values. They return either true or false depending on the comparison.For example: 5 > 3 is true, 10 == "10" 
     is true, but 10 === "10" is false because one is a number and the other is a string.

# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
  1. **Switch Statement** - I know that a switch statement in JavaScript is used to compare one value against different possible cases, and it is often easier to read than writing many
     if/else statements. I can describe its structure with case, break, and default, but I still get confused about when to use it instead of if/else. Sometimes I also forget to put break, which
     causes fall-through and makes my code act differently than I intended. I need more practice with real examples so I can use switch statements more confidently and effectively.
  2. **For Loop** - I know that a for loop in JavaScript is used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. I can describe how it works, but I sometimes get mixed up with the syntax
     or forget when the loop should stop. I also find it tricky to decide when to use a for loop compared to other loops like while. I need more practice writing different examples so I can use
     for loops more smoothly and without confusion.
  3. **While Loop** - I know that a while loop in JavaScript is used to repeat code as long as a condition remains true. I can explain that it checks the condition before running, but I sometimes
     forget how to avoid infinite loops if the condition never changes. I also get unsure about when it is better to use a while loop instead of a for loop.
  4. **Do While Loop** - I know that a do…while loop in JavaScript runs the code block at least once before checking the condition, which makes it different from a regular while loop. I can describe 
     its structure, but I sometimes forget the exact placement of the condition at the end. I also get confused about when using a do…while is better than just using while.
  5. **Functions** - I know that functions in JavaScript help organize code by grouping instructions together so they can be reused. I can explain that they can take inputs (parameters) and give
     back outputs (return values), but I sometimes forget how scope affects variables inside and outside the function. I also get a little confused when functions call other functions or when 
     they are nested.

# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
  My plan of action to better understand the topics I struggle with is to set aside regular time for practice by writing small pieces of code for each concept, like loops, functions, and switch
  statements. I will also review my class notes and watch tutorials so I can see different explanations and examples of the same topics. Another step I will take is to ask questions from my 
  teacher or classmates whenever I get confused, instead of leaving it unclear. Finally, I will challenge myself with simple coding exercises or projects, since applying what I learn in real 
  examples will make the concepts stick better in my brain..

# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
  ##  EFFECTIVE
  1. **Most of the Practical graded exercises** - These were effective because they gave me the chance to apply the lessons in a hands-on way, which helped me understand the topics better.
  2. **7th Graded Exercise** - this was effective since it pushed me to think critically, find errors, and fix them, which made me more confident in problem-solving.
  ## NOT EFFECTIVE
  1. **2nd Graded Exercise** - It was not very effective because it was almost the same as the examples we already did in class, so it didn’t challenge me further.
  2. **First Non-Graded Exercise** - This was also not very effective since it was too easy and straightforward, so it felt more like simple practice rather than something that deepened 
     my understanding.
